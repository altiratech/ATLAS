# Altira Atlas

**Real-assets intelligence and underwriting platform** for land research, scenario modeling, and investment diligence, starting with farmland.

Current live coverage starts with farmland research and underwriting. Near-term expansion stays focused on industrial, logistics, data-center, energy, and development-oriented land. Selected commercial real estate workflows are later-phase work where site, infrastructure, and location drive value. Atlas is not intended to become a generic PE research terminal or a full-spectrum CRE operating system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone / download the project, then:
cd Code/active/farmland-terminal

# Option 1: Native desktop window (requires pywebview)
./run.sh

# Option 2: Open in your default browser
./run.sh --browser

# Option 3: API server only (headless)
./run.sh --server
```

The app auto-installs dependencies, initializes schema-only local storage, and launches at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies (auto-installed by `run.sh`):
  - `fastapi`, `uvicorn` — API server
  - `sqlalchemy` — Database ORM
  - `pydantic` — Data validation
  - `numpy` — Numeric computation
  - `pywebview` — Native desktop window (optional; falls back to browser)

Manual install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Features

### Core Analytics
- **15-metric valuation engine** with DAG-based dependency resolution (topological sort ensures correct computation order)
- **Gordon Growth Model** fair value: `FV = NOI × (1+g) / (r − g)` with configurable risk premium, growth rate, and guardrails
- **Implied cap rate**, rent multiples, DSCR, payback period, cap spread to 10Y Treasury
- **Access Score** (0–100) based on Haversine-distance proximity to grain elevators, ethanol plants, rail terminals, and river ports

### Dashboard
- Aggregate statistics across all 45 tracked counties
- Median/mean metrics summary (cap rate, fair value, cash rent, etc.)
- Top movers — counties with largest YoY metric changes
- State-level summary breakdown

### County Deep Dive
- Full metric profile with all 15 computed metrics
- 11-year time series (2015–2025) with sparkline charts
- Access score breakdown showing nearest facilities
- Notes system — attach research notes to any county

### Screener
- Filter counties by state, minimum cap rate, and sort criteria
- Real-time results with all key metrics
- CSV export of full screener results

### Watchlist
- Track counties of interest with one-click add/remove
- YoY change tracking for key metrics
- Persistent across sessions

### Comparison Tool
- Side-by-side comparison of up to 6 counties
- Full metric comparison table
- Identifies advantages/disadvantages for each county

### Portfolio Manager
- Create portfolios with multiple holdings (county + acres + purchase price)
- Weighted metric aggregation across holdings
- HHI-based diversification rating (Concentrated → Moderate → Well-Diversified → Excellent)
- State exposure analysis
- Unrealized gain/loss tracking
- Portfolio yield calculation

### Scenario Lab
- Override any assumption (risk premium, growth rate, etc.) and see fair value impact
- Sensitivity analysis — vary a parameter across multiple values
- Pre-built sensitivity matrix: discount rate × growth rate grid for any county
- Rent shock analysis (±10%, ±20%, ±30%)

### Backtesting
- Run screens against historical data
- Evaluate how screen criteria performed over configurable time horizons
- Identifies counties flagged by screen criteria

### Search & Command Palette
- `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` to open command palette
- Search counties by name, state, or FIPS code
- Search metrics by name
- Quick navigation to any county

### Product Orientation
- In-app **Mission** page explains what the platform is, who it serves, and why each tool exists
- In-app **About** page clarifies scope and near-term roadmap priorities
- Canonical web app URL: `https://atlas.altiratech.com`
- `https://atlas.altiratech.com/altiratech-home` serves a compatibility mirror of the canonical company homepage source at `Code/active/altiratech-site/public/index.html`

## Identity And Billing Compatibility

- Atlas currently uses module-local session auth via `/api/v1/auth/bootstrap`.
- Optional edge identity headers can seed Atlas sessions in protected environments, but that is not the long-term default end-user identity model.
- Atlas should stay compatible with a shared Altira account/workspace/membership model rather than invent product-local billing or entitlement systems.
- Visible roles should remain simple when suite auth lands: `user`, `manager`, `admin`.
- Workspace billing, subscriptions, and module entitlements should live above Atlas, not inside Atlas.
- Enterprise SSO is a later layer, not the default auth assumption for this module.

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite (zero-config, portable database)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Babel standalone (no build step, single HTML file)
- **Cloud Deploy Profile**: Cloudflare Workers + Hono + D1 (`deploy/cloudflare-worker`)
- **Desktop**: pywebview for native OS window (WebKit on macOS, EdgeChromium on Windows)
- **Database**: SQLite stored at `backend/farmland.db` (auto-created on first run)

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Expected baseline is 61 tests; one portfolio test can fail if using a persistent local DB with prior state.

## Data

This workspace follows the no-synthetic-data policy (`D-014`):
- Runtime paths do not auto-seed fabricated records.
- Local SQLite starts schema-only.
- Production data should come from live ingestion sources (USDA NASS / FRED via the Cloudflare Worker).
- If data is unavailable, use explicit placeholders rather than generated samples.

See `docs/ADDING_DATA_AND_METRICS.md` for instructions on adding custom data and metrics.
